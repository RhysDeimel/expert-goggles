## TODO
 - Actually tidy up some of the things I've done and put them in here.
 
### General Notes
 - Sensors usually have associated libraries. Use them.
 - Drama with ESP8266 - http://www.instructables.com/id/Beginners-Guide-to-ESP8266-and-Tweeting-Using-ESP8/
  -- uses 3.3v logic. Arduino Uno uses 5v. Convert?
- Download git based libraries with: https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home
- Webserver without library - http://allaboutee.com/2014/12/30/esp8266-and-arduino-webserver/

- !!!! Change ESP baud rate with "AT+UART_DEF=9600,8,1,0,0". Arduino Uno has problems with 115200 - http://www.instructables.com/id/Cheap-Arduino-WiFi-Shield-With-ESP8266/

- https://github.com/bportaluri/WiFiEsp: Seems like a promising library.
