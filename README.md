## TODO

### General Notes
 - Sensors usually have associated libraries. Use them.
 - Drama with ESP8266 - http://www.instructables.com/id/Beginners-Guide-to-ESP8266-and-Tweeting-Using-ESP8/
  -- uses 3.3v logic. Arduino Uno uses 5v. Convert?
- Download git based libraries with: https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home
- Webserver without library
