> An arduino button pusher to activate my aircon on a set timer

I am currently living in the top floor of two story duplex. While it does give a nice view, it unfortunately means that all the heat in the house rises up to my bedroom and turns it into a furnace. This is not fun when you're trying to sleep. The room does have a wall mounted air-con, but having it run all night is not the most economical. Ideally, I would like to have the air-con run long enough for me to fall asleep, and then cycle on for 15 minutes in every hour.

The air-con only has a simple sleep timer and does not have a programmable option to do what I would like. Because of this, I plan to experiment with a mechanical solution using an arduino and a solonoid/servo to turn the air-con on and off via the remote. My experience with ardiuino is limited, so this will be an interesting learning experience.
